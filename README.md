# CRC-Implementation-in-C
## PROBLEM STATEMENT
A program to calculate CRC for a given stream of data and calculations of CRC has to be done using three methods
- CRC using bit-by-bit method
- CRC using byte-by-byte method
- An improved version of byte by byte
And finally measure the timing for each method
 
 ## THEORY
 
Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) is a block code invented by W. Wesley Peterson in 1961. It is commonly used to detect accidental changes to data transmitted via telecommunications networks and storage devices.
CRC involves binary division of the data bits being sent by a predetermined divisor agreed upon by the communicating system. The divisor is generated using polynomials. So, CRC is also called polynomial code checksum.
